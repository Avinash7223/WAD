        <h1>Artificial Intelligrnce</h1>
        <p>
            the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled 
            robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings.

        <h1>What is intelligence?</h1>
        <p style="font-family:arial; font-style:italic; color:red;">
            All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, 
            while even the most complicated insect behaviour is usually not taken as an indication of intelligence.

            Employing the methods outlined above, AI research attempts to reach one of three goals: 
            artificial general intelligence (AGI), applied AI, or cognitive simulation. 
            AGI (also called strong AI) aims to build machines that think.
